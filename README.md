# üë≥üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üíª

I'm a self-taught software engineer with more than three years of professional experience. Originally coming from a medical background, my journey into software development began out of curiosity and a genuine passion for technology and problem-solving. Currently, I specialize in creating robust, scalable web applications that deliver seamless user experiences.
